This project is a low level chat programming for linux, it's so basic program. Program just send a one byte. You can't write with UTF-8 character

Firstly, if you want the use program, you have to write "make" command in terminal chat, withouth " characters, just make.

Then you have a two file. client and server. Now you need two terminal windows, one will be client and other terminal will be server. 

Firstly you have to run server, you can run server with this command "./server", after that you can see pid id on your screen, this is process id of server. 

Secondly, if you want text to server, you have to run client, with this command "./client". Client program can take a 2 argument, first argument is server pid id, second argument is message context, you can write everything(without UTF8 and special character). This project just it. So basic chat program for local system.
